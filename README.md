This is a project that utilizes blockchain technology to prevent academic credential fraud. The project aims to address some of the issues present in traditional academic credential verification systems, such as information asymmetry, lack of trust, and fraud. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project can effectively record and verify users' academic credentials, thereby enhancing the authenticity and credibility of the information.

The project utilizes Go language and Hyperledger Fabric framework for implementation. Go language is an efficient, secure, and cross-platform programming language suitable for developing high-performance and distributed applications. Hyperledger Fabric is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform that provides rich functionalities and tools, supporting multiple consensus mechanisms and smart contract languages.

The core functionalities of the project include adding credentials, modifying credentials, and querying credentials. Users can add their academic credentials to the blockchain system using smart contracts, including information such as the type of credential, the institution of graduation, and the duration of study. Users can also modify their credentials using smart contracts; however, the modified information leaves a trace for easy traceability and verification. Additionally, users can query their own or other users' academic credentials in the blockchain system to verify their authenticity.

The project's strengths and innovations lie in the use of Fabric with Couchdb database, achieving distributed database and tamper-resistance. Fabric consists of an ordered, tamper-resistant state transition record, including both the blockchain and the world state. The blockchain stores immutable sequential records, including configuration records and transaction records. The world state maintains the current state of the ledger, facilitating rapid application queries. Couchdb is a document-oriented database capable of storing complex structured data and supporting rich query capabilities. Using Fabric and Couchdb enables distributed storage and processing of data, enhancing the system's reliability and scalability.

Another advantage of the project is the utilization of Hyperledger Explorer, enabling visual monitoring of the blockchain network and data. Explorer is a web-based application that displays information such as nodes, channels, transactions, and contracts within the blockchain network, providing charts and statistical analysis capabilities. Users can conveniently manage and monitor the blockchain network through a web browser, enhancing the system's availability and maintainability.

Moreover, the project holds great potential to positively impact the social and educational sectors.

At the societal level, firstly, by addressing academic fraud, this system can enhance social trust. In traditional academic credential verification systems, academic fraud is a widespread issue, causing significant challenges for recruiters and employers. Through the use of blockchain technology, all academic information can be permanently and immutably recorded and easily verified, significantly reducing the likelihood of academic fraud and enhancing overall societal trust. Secondly, the system can enhance the efficiency of educational resource utilization. In traditional academic credential verification systems, schools need to invest significant human and material resources in issuing and managing academic certificates. By leveraging blockchain technology, academic certificates can be digitized and stored on the blockchain, leading to substantial cost savings in certificate issuance and management. Additionally, the system facilitates cross-institution and cross-regional academic credential verification, improving the efficiency of educational resource utilization. Lastly, the system can promote educational equity. In traditional academic credential verification systems, certain regions or disadvantaged groups may struggle to obtain fair academic credential verification opportunities. Through blockchain technology, all academic information can be permanently and immut
